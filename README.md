# Countries&Capitals

## Description
Countries and capitals is a github application meant to help learners and the global public at large to be<br>
to know all the countries of Africa, their capital cities as well as their flags"

## Behaviour Driven Development
BDD focuses on the expected user experience with the app.
<br>
As the creator the intended functionality for this application is that the user will:
<br>
1. Be met with a landing page with a brief description of the application where he/she is expected<br> to click the 
   get started button.
2. They are then expected to navigate through the grid seeing different countries or if not, the user can search for<br>
3. the required country by inputting the country name or capital in the search bar.
4. 

The application has undergone unit testing with roboelectric to ensure it works as expected.
